The Gaea Co-Op are a primarily Martian based society. Their territory is [[Gaea]], the first-made Martian bubble city. They are a highly democratic, logical faction who formed from mass-migration after the originally earth-based space freight business [[Gaea Co-Op]] made huge investments in research and development of space-travel technology.

This massive investment sparked the invention of the [[Ashton Drive]] named after [[Richard Ashton]] the initial scientist responsible for it's design. With this huge innovation, humanity's ability to travel through space was drastically improved, initiating a huge global expansion of space-based operations and allowing humanity to move beyond its home world.

Gaea is in recent times known for its continued technological growth in fields such as terraforming and medical sciences, relocating it's industry entirely to Mars
