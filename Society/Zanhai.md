notes: 
The Zanhai are a refugee race, wandering the stars looking for a new home world to restart their civilization. They struggle to achieve their goal due to multiple splinter factions fighting over beliefs, resources and the validity of their claims to rule their own people. Often the remnants of the Zanhai are bounty hunters, contractors to the highest bidders and wanderers. Their high intelligence and technological advancements still places them as a high level threat, but if not provoked, typically do not interfere in human affairs.
