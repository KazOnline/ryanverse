The [[Zanhai]] people were an advanced alien race, propelled to great heights through a golden age of science. For hundreds of years they crafted marvels of medicine and fostered a culture to cast a shadow on all others. The downfall of their society came through stagnation and a strong disposition for war with other civilizations over recourses to fuel their own people. A leader rose to power through cunning and ruthless aggression that pulled the Zanhai in a path that led to their destruction. His name was [[Namir]].

The Zanhai discovered an abundance of rare and valuable materials crucial to fuelling their society on the home world of their ancient enemy, the [[Urgnott]]. Through decades of war and attrition, the sheer numbers of the urgnott horde started to push back the advances of the Zanhai war legions. Through arrogance, Namir ordered the commission of a deadly pathogen designed to rampage through the nervous system, destroying  the immune system and shutting down organ function. This pathogen was labelled [[Valphage]], named after the scientist that crafted the deadly pathogen.  The lead scientist, [[Dr Eratte Valhim]] warned Namir of the potency and issues containing it.

The price of Ignoring Dr Valhim's warnings came to fruition and an outbreak of the Valphage broke out on the home world of the Zanhai people. The effiency of the pathogen was greater than even Dr Valhim expected. It tore down the once prosperous civilization in a matter of days, leaving none left alive on the planet. Now the only remnants of the Zanhai people, survivors of the Urgnott wars, merchant vessels and explorers, are drifting through space, lost and alone. Looking for a new home to rebuild and avoid the same mistakes that brought their people to ruin.

Valphage remains dormant on the surface of the planet, waiting for the next organic host it can latch on to and enact it's malevolent design.
