The Slingshot (GCA-132) was a fleet-carrier class interplanetary military vessel successfully surviving sixteen combat missions within both orbital and belt territories over the course of its six years of service.

Belonging to the [[Gaea Co-Op]] its primary purpose was the defence of trade between Mars and the rock-belt for the dome-building initiative in Meridiani Planum (later [[Meridia]]). In the sixth year of the course, the ship was swarmed by a collective of rock-belt originating pirates belonging to the [[Justice for Rock-Hoppers]] criminal organisation who had been waiting for the ship to be relatively weak in terms of defensive on-board ships to steal valuable oxygen production and recycling equipment bound for mars.

Historians such as [[A. Carter(Historian)]] have noted that though not explicitly spread through mainstream news channels, the justification given by the few pirates captured was due to the Martian water-harvesting initiative allegedly depriving rock-belt stations of drinking water leading to an alleged increase in health difficulties in the under-funded stations.

The pirates successfully boarded GCA-132 and over the course of three days slaughtered the crew of three thousand people onboard and claimed the ship, renaming it [[World Taker]] and repurposing it for many years to house their organisation and perform the illegal seizure and destruction of Gaean vessels.

It was later destroyed some fifteen years later after operating in the rock-belt as a hub for many criminal organisations, most of whom were wiped out in the process by a joint cooperative between Martian and Earth-based militaries.

It is hailed in the solar system as the greatest cooperative effort between criminal organisations to fight back against the "tyrannical nations of Earth and Mars."
