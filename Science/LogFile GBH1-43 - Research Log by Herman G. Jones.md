Situation: In High Orbit of GBH1-43, aboard [[RARS Bentley]]
Location: Â Alpha Centauri, Outer System

**Entry 1: 18/04/2092 20:06 (GMT+1)**
I have been informed by [[Captain Phillips]] that we've completed our deceleration burn around [[GBH1-43]]. I've spent the last hour booting and validating sensor systems and detector arrays along the portside hull to begin our initial investigation.

In university we had to do a two week module on writing professional research notes. However, THIS IS AWESOME! I am orbiting a black hole only recently discovered in our neighbour star system!

The research we do here could potentially *change the world*. It took us over 4 years to travel here. Imagine if we could do that in minutes as a result of our discoveries here! Okay, that's enough rambling.

I've completely initialized the lab and finished fixing the boot errors on LAB_PC_04. It still had the stock anti-virus which was deeply disagreeing with our shared drive. All of our equipment is operational!

As per the flight plan, [[Captain Phillips]] has put us in a polar orbit. We're going to do 3 full rotations before performing two retrograde burns to lower our orbital radius. Gradually we will get closer and closer taking readings as we go down until we hit a minimum safe distance; from here we will operate for several weeks running tests on emissions, mass, force affect, light refractions and every other possible thing I can. (I'm excited!)

For now, it's time to sleep. Tomorrow is a big day. Time to study some black holes!

Today was long, but I am required to maintain these logs about my work outside of actual research documents so I will update them either way. The majority of today was sampling. I challenge you to spend 12 hours changing settings and clicking 'go' without burning through your excitement.

Either way, some interesting problems I ran into. We brought infrared sensors for temperature testing. Infrared sensors. In the vaccum of space. For an object that absorbs light. I'm going to have to boil that down to 26 year old me being too excited with my nice big budget from the [[Royal Astronomical Research Society]].

Tomorrow is all about sampling again and on the third day in this orbit I'll be processing some data while orbital manoeuvres are underway. I'll likely update this log next time something interesting happens. Also, having no acceleration sucks, I miss constant g-forces, I keep forgetting to put lids on my mug.

**Entry 3: 30/04/2092 11:41(GMT+1)**
It's the final day of our third orbital pattern. We're maintaining a polar orbit for the duration of the mission. Tomorrow is the final orbit. Before leaving, I had to spend hours analysing satellite and telescope data to decide on a minimum safe orbital height where I could still take the readings I needed. Admittedly, those hours ended at about 4AM the morning of the flight plan submission to the society. But still.

The research! I'm getting some *veery* interesting raw data from gravity calculations. Naturally, I'm getting a much better resolution at this distance and it's almost like there's *less* than their should be. By a factor of 0.7! If I didn't know any better, I'd say it's hollow. Still nothing visual.

This is going to be some seriously interesting observations. I've taken enough readings over the last week and a half to fill four drives in the database. I only have 6 left and I haven't even processed most of the data yet. That's what the 4 year journey home is for.

To science!

**Entry 4: 02/05/2092 16:07(GMT+1)**
Based on the higher resolution readings I've managed to convinced [[Captain Phillips]] to take us even closer! With a lower gravity reading, the MSD is naturally lower by roughly the same factor. We're making the corrections as we speak.

**Entry 5: 02/05/2092 17:22(GMT+1)**
I've just ran a diagnostic in some downtime and I seem to be getting some weird readings out of my gravimeter. I'm going to investigate while the crew stabilize the orbit.

**Entry 6: 02/05/2092 19:41(GMT+1)**
Not good! Like most of the bulky, high-precision test equipment we loaded it externally. It's on the outer hull. I used a remote camera to do some close-up inspections and there's a very *very* slight damage to the laser array harness. It looks like some debris caught it. I've looked at the technical docs of the unit and it looks like laser AC-2 won't be reading correctly. Why didn't this come up as a warning outside of a diagnostic!!

**Entry 7: 04/05/2092 02:03(GMT+1)**
This will be my last entry. I'm sending this out before anything goes horribly wrong as a final report with all of my data. Something needs to come from this.

Do not be mistaken, we will die here. I've included a standard RCA accident report below.

Accident Report: FA01-A
Severity: Mission Critical
Fatality: 100%
Incidents: 2

Incident 1:
Root Cause Analysis: Manual deviation from set flight plant
Extent: Deviation guided by false readings as a result of improperly functioning test equipment. Maximum safe distance breached.
Risk: Medium

Incident 2:
Root Cause Analysis: Damaged Injection System
Extent: PFIJ-01 damaged as a result of hardware inspection from Incident 1. Main engine can no longer accept fuel.
Additional Context: Secondary engines are not strong enough to generate escape velocity from below minimum safe orbital radius.
Risk: Fatal

Persons Affected: All Crew (RARS Bentley)

Findings Report:
The anomaly - blackhole - whatever... It *does* have less mass. However, it doesn't throw off it's orbit. Why? Because it isn't a solid mass. I can't calculate it's mass value beyond the event horizon. I believe, based on the orbital data recorded and my other reasons in the data dumps above, that it is externally linked through some *external* space to something else. It's not a Black Hole, it's a wormhole.
