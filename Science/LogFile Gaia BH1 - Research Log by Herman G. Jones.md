I have been informed by [[Captain Phillips]] that we've completed our deceleration burn around [[GBH1-43]]. I've spent the last hour booting and validating sensor systems and detector arrays along the portside hull to begin our initial investigation.

In university we had to do a two week module on writing professional research notes. However, THIS IS AWESOME! I am orbiting a black hole only recently discovered in our neighbour star system!

The research we do here could potentially *change the world*. It took us over 4 years to travel here. Imagine if we could do that in minutes as a result of our discoveries here! Okay, that's enough rambling.

I've completely initialized the lab and finished fixing the boot errors on LAB_PC_04. It still had the stock anti-virus which was deeply disagreeing with our shared drive. All of our equipment is operational!

As per the flight plan, [[Captain Phillips]] has put us in a polar orbit. We're going to do 3 full rotations before performing two retrograde burns to lower our orbital radius. Gradually we will get closer and closer taking readings as we go down until we hit a minimum safe distance; from here we will operate for several weeks running tests on emissions, mass, force affect, light refractions and every other possible thing I can. (I'm excited!)

For now, it's time to sleep. Tomorrow is a big day. Time to study some black holes!
